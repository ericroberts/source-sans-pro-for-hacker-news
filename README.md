Source Sans Pro For Hacker News
===============================

Rework of the [Georgify for Hacker News](http://userstyles.org/styles/46180/georgify-for-hacker-news) styles to use Source Sans Pro.

**Source Sans Pro must be installed on your system**. If you don't have Source Sans Pro, it will go back to Georgia (I think). I was too lazy to put a proper font stack in.

Not much to say. I use the [Stylish extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe?hl=en) for Chrome. Once you've got it you can add a new style. Copy and paste the contents of source-sans-pro-ify.css and then set "Applies to" to be "URLs on the domain" and fill in the field with news.ycombinator.com. At some point I might just add it to the stylish site and make it easier.
